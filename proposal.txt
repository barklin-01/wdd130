CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
OrderManager: Order registration system

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
The problem I want to solve is that a customer sends an order via messages and many 
times that order gets lost among so many messages or sometimes gets confused.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
What I can learn by making this program is how to use CSV files to store data, 
validate user input, design functions, and structure data as dictionaries and lists.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
My program will use the csv module to save the orders and the datetime module to record the date.

5. List the names of functions you will need?

get_user_input() – Requests order data.
create_order_record(quantity, size, bust, color, model, image) – Creates a dictionary containing an order.
save_order(order) – Saves an order to a CSV file.
load_orders() – Loads all orders from the file.
display_orders() – Displays all existing orders.
validate_input(data) – Validates the data.

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

test_create_order_record()
test_save_and_load_order()
test_validate_input()
